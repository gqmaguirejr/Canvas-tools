# This file contains several dicts and lists - these contain 'word' entries, but a 'word' can actually be a string of several words.
#
# Lists have been used when there can be multiple entries for the same 'word' and where there is not CEFR and POS information.
#
#
# Each dict's structure is:
# dict_name = {
#    entry,
#    entry,
# }
# Each entry is a 'word': CEFR_POS_dict
#
# a CEFR_POS_dict entry is a dict with the keys being CEFR levels (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, XX, and NA)
# followed by a string that contains comma separated POS
#
# The code 'XX' is used for an unknown CEFR level, while NA is for use when no level is applicable:
